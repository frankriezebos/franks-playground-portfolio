# franks-playground-portfolio

After building dozens of closed source websites (for customers) in the last 10 years, this is my very first public / open source project. That means you can see my code and re-use it if you want ^^,

It's actually just my playground website to experiment with modern Front-End tech but I also try to offer interactive experiences like nature and cultures discovery.
I'm using a design based on nature's philosophy and modern design.

I've designed it firsti in Figma. Figma is an awesome free (browser-based) design tool with plugin support and prototype functionalities. It works almost the same as Sketch but faster and for free.
